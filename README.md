# üìà Bonus: Warm Lead Signals to Watch

### üîç A. Job Post Signals (Step-by-Step)

Job postings = real-time signals that a company is investing in IT, security, or compliance. This means they‚Äôre very likely open to outsourcing or consultation ‚Äî even if they don‚Äôt say it.

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 1: Identify the Right Job Titles to Watch For

Look for companies hiring:
- **CISO (Chief Information Security Officer)** 
- **IT Director / Manager** 
- **Compliance Officer / Analyst** 
- **Cybersecurity Engineer / Specialist** 
- **Network Administrator / Systems Administrator** 

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 2: Search Job Boards

Use these platforms:
- **LinkedIn Jobs** ‚Äì Best for tech and compliance roles
- **Indeed** ‚Äì Broad coverage of SMBs and regional businesses
- **ZipRecruiter**, **Glassdoor**, or niche job boards (e.g. Dice for tech)

Search with keywords like:
- `"compliance"`
- `"cybersecurity"`
- `"IT Director"`

Apply filters:
- Location: US-based or your target region
- Company size (if available)
- Posting date: Last 7‚Äì30 days

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 3: Qualify the Company

For each company posting:
1. Look at the **job description**
   - Do they mention **regulations, audits, IT modernization, security framework work**?
   - Are they **small or mid-sized** (10‚Äì500 employees)? They‚Äôre more likely to need **external help**.

2. Google the company:
   - Look at their website ‚Äî do they appear **tech-mature or outdated**?
   - Are they already working with vendors?

3. Check their LinkedIn company page:
   - Size, growth, who‚Äôs already on the IT/compliance team

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 4: Find the Decision-Makers

Use LinkedIn:
- Search for people at the company with titles like:
  - IT Director
  - VP of Operations
  - Compliance Manager
  - CEO (if it‚Äôs a small business)

Save their:
- Name
- Email (if available via Apollo/Lusha)
- LinkedIn profile link

---

#### ‚úÖ Step 5: Outreach Messaging




### B. RFP Signals
- Check public RFP boards:
  - SAM.gov, BidNet, RFPDB.com
- Look for bids related to:
  - Cybersecurity, IT support, network audits

### C. Technology Stack Signals
- Use tools like BuiltWith or SimilarTech to find companies:
  - Using outdated tech (e.g., legacy firewalls, on-prem servers)
  - Likely needing upgrades or compliance services

---
#### üéØ GOAL:
Use Upwork job posts as **live intent signals** ‚Äî then either:
1. **Bid strategically** to win direct business
2. **Extract company contact info** to outreach outside the platform

---


USING UPWORK:

#### üîç Step 1: Use Advanced Search Filters

Go to Upwork's ‚ÄúFind Work‚Äù tab, then apply filters:
- **Keywords**:
- **Client Info**:
---

#### üß≠ Step 2: Identify Qualified Leads

For each job post, look for:
- Clear pain points
- Long-term potential: ‚ÄúOngoing security help,‚Äù ‚ÄúPolicy documentation + IT monitoring‚Äù
- Decision-maker involvement: Posts written in first-person ("My company...") often = small business owner or direct buyer

Copy down:
- **Company/Client name** (if visible)
- **Description details**
- **Job link**
- **Post date**

---

#### üîó Step 3: Decide Your Play (2 Paths)

**A. Direct Bid (On Platform):**
- Customize bid by referencing exact compliance framework
- Offer value in proposal:  

**B. Off-Platform Prospecting (Advanced):**
- Use clues from the job post:
  - Company name or domain in screenshots
  - Client first name + location
- Google or LinkedIn search them
- Add to your outbound email/LinkedIn list  
 

‚ö†Ô∏è Be subtle ‚Äî Upwork discourages off-platform messaging.
